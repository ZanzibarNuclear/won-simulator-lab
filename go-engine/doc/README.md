# Development Notes

## 2024-09-04

Something like the following happened in the past few weeks:

- Added a `Simulation` struct to manage the simulation state and parts.
- Added a `Part` interface to represent a part in the simulation.
- Added a `Boiler` struct to represent a boiler in the simulation.
- Added a `Turbine` struct to represent a turbine in the simulation.
- Added a `Generator` struct to represent a generator in the simulation.
